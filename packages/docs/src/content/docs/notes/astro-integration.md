## TODO

- Vite/Astro plugin which would provide
  - [Virtual Module](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin#virtual-modules-convention) with braindb instance configured with [sensible defaults](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com/recipes/braindb/)
  - configure other defaults for Astro as `optimizeDeps.exclude`
- [remark plugin for wikilinks](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com/recipes/wikilinks/)
  - handle anchors
  - handle image wikilinks
